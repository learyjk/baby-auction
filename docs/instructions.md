I want to create a website where my friends can bet on the weight, day, and time that HEather and my baby will be born. The current due date is Dec 11 2025. The most expensive block should be the one on the given due date and the average weight for a baby in the Bay Area USA. As far as the time goes, users should be able to choose any hour on a 24-hour clock. No price difference for the chosen hour. We can work on the pricing algorithm later. For now, I want to work on a visual. It will be a cube of cubes. Each cube in the cube represents a discreet vote (i..e Dec 12 2025, 7.6 lbs, 1300). I think we should probably use three.js for this.
